# Oppeneigen Image Retrival System
> CBIR (Content-Based Image Retrieval) using Python Flask is an innovative project that harnesses the power of color and texture features to enable efficient image retrieval. The color feature extraction method in this system is based on the Histogram of HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) colors. It accurately captures the distribution of colors in images, enabling precise comparison and retrieval of similar images based on color similarity. For texture feature extraction, the system utilizes a Co-occurrence Matrix coupled with various texture parameters. These parameters include: contrast, homogeinity, entropy,  correlation, angular second moment, energy, distortion, dissimilarity, and inverse contrast.
